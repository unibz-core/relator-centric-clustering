# Conceptual Model Clustering: A Relator-Centric Approach <br>Supplementary Materials

This repository contains supplementary materials for the research paper (under review):

Guizzardi, G., Sales, T. P., Almeida, J. P. A., & Poels, G. (2021). **Conceptual Model Clustering: A Relator-Centric Approach**. Software and Systems Modeling.

In the paper, we report on an empirical experiment in which conceptual modeling experts express their preferences for different modularization strategies.

Here you will find the material related to this experiment:

* The dataset containing the answers to the survey ([/answers.csv](/answers.csv))
* The survey forms used in the experiment

PS: This dataset is completely anonymied, as we did not collect any information that could be used uncover the identity of the participants.
