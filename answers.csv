One observation is that the class Organization is missing in the employment module and that looks strange to me. Alt-B has also relatively small modules and although the highlighted entities were  roles instead of relators, I also found that ok. Many times, we do reason about a model from the perspective of ""who"" does ""what"" and such approach facilitates that. The worst alternative was Alt-A, because the modularization was unbalanced in terms of the size of the modules. Still, too much had to be read in the Car Rental module and that made me very confuse.

Alt-C is organized by events too. But it separates close concepts in distinct modules (e.g., Man and Woman, Deceased and Living Person, Personal and Corporate Customer). It makes the model harder do understand.
Alt-B is very confusing, having modules with incomplete relations (e.g., Marriage with Husband omitted), incomplete specializations (e.g., Deceased Person separated from Living Person), and missing relations (e.g., from Car Rental to Responsible Employee and Rental Car). This is not intuitive.
As a suggestion, in Alt-A, I would separate the Car Rental topic as a new module (apart from Person), and integrate the Marriage module to the Person one. Like so, we would have four modules for the topics: Person (and its “business independent” specializations), Employment, Car Ownership, and Car Rental."
